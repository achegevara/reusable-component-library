Here is the 'Reusable component library' project, which I developed while studying the 'Modern HTML and CSS' course.
You can test it via GitHub Pages using this link: https://achegevara.github.io/reusable-component-library/

In case you download project files and open project locally, please open any files with live server, the project uses svg-sprite.*
